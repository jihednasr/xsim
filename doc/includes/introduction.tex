The goal of Xsim is to simulate the network of a SoC in order to allow the 
simulation of each node of the SoC on a different host core. This should increase
the parallelism of the simulation and so reduce its simulation time.

Each node of the simulation can be simulated in SystemC (or an other system)
and link to Xsim via its interface. Xsim simulates the network of the chip
and so only send messages from one node to another with the good time constraints.
